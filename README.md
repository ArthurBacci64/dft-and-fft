# dft-and-fft

An implementation of a DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) and a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) in C

# Compiling

```
cc *.c -lncurses -lm -o main
```

If you do not want to compile with ncurses, then delete "show.h" and "show.c", and remove the `#include "show.h"` from the other files.

After it, you can compile with:

```
cc *.c -lm -o main
```

# Running

```
./main
```

Running is not so difficult.
